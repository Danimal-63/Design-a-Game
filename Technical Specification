1.  Each character will be its own object and the enemies will all be their own objects 
  - the characters all have different skills 
    - attack, defense, hp --> each features of the characters 
  - the enemies are controlled by the computer and sent out in waves 
    - the enemies all have a strength 
  - there is an upgrade feature 
    - the user can choose upgrades at the end of each round 
  - time will be tracked as a variable 
  - gain points from defeating enemies 
      - score should also be a variable that restarts each game 
      - but no information as to how they defeat enemies 
      - but 1 point per enemy at the most basic enemy strength and it increases (although no info as to how is increases) as the enemies get stronger 
2.  Basically the entire time the fighting between the user's character and the enemy is assumed you are aware of what is happening and nothing is explained 
  - no information as to how the user picks their character, when the computer sends out more enemies, how the enemies gain strength, how the users fight the enemies
  - also no information about how the user gets achievements, what they are, how they are earned, and how they are used 
3.  character's skills > character's score > enemies' strength > upgradable ability 
4.  Coding the character's skills will be the hardest part along with how the character's visually portray their skills 
  - also, with so little information, coding the possible character's to chose from will be challenging 
  - there is basically no design, so there is very little information to code off of and I think that will take time to sort out 
  - the controls are also changable with each player, which may be hard to give the user options for controls 
  
5.  Variables: 
    - attack level --> local 
    - defense level --> local 
    - hp --> local 
    - character special skills --> global 
    - user controls --> local? 
    - enemy strength --> local 
    - number of enemies --> local
    - time --> local 
    - achievements --> global 
    - characters --> global 
       - characters should be an arraylist of arraylists 
         - bc there are tons of characters (?) and each character has attributes 
            - their skills, their attack level, defense level, etc. 
 6. enemy strength should be increased as the character is defeating enemies
